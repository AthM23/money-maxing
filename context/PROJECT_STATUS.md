# Project Status — money-maxing

**Source of truth.** Read this before starting work. Append to it after anything
notable. See [`README.md`](./README.md) for the rules.

## Current direction

**Not yet locked.** What we know from the judge:

- The product space is **autonomous finance-ops agents** — automating the context
  collection and bookkeeping work that happens *before* financial statements get
  prepared, not the statement analysis itself.
- Judged on three axes: **ambition** (cross-function > single-function),
  **frontier-ness** (right models / partners / memory layer), and **difficulty of
  the chosen process** (equity > revenue ≈ collections ≈ payroll > cash).
- **Hard requirement: fully autonomous.** Human is pulled in *only* on a genuine
  context blocker, and the answer must be written to memory and reused
  automatically thereafter.

### Decision needed

Pick the shape of the build:

- **(A) Deep in one function** — realistic. Revenue end-to-end is the judge's own
  worked example. Medium difficulty score.
- **(B) Cross-function multi-agent** — ambitious, riskier, scores higher on
  ambition. e.g. cash agent that also queries payroll + equity agents.
- **(C) Equity** — highest difficulty score, most context-hungry (state + federal
  law, cap tables), hardest to fake convincingly in 24h.

## Open questions

- Which function(s) are we committing to? (see Decision needed above)
- What's the memory layer? The judge explicitly grades this — "the right memory
  layer" is one of the three axes.
- What data sources do we simulate vs. actually integrate (email, Slack, bank
  statements, accounting system)?
- What's the fixture company? Needs to look ~Series A, not a two-person startup.
- How do we stage the escalate → answer → remember demo so it's legible in a
  short pitch?

## Log

### 2026-09-19 — Context folder created; judge interview captured

- Created `context/` as the shared source of truth for humans and agents.
- Added `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file) and `README.md` with the logging rules.
- Recorded the judge/sponsor interview: summary + raw transcript in
  [`judge-interview-2026-09-19.md`](./judge-interview-2026-09-19.md).
- Key takeaways now driving the build: autonomy is mandatory, memory is the
  thesis (not a feature), cash reconciliation alone is the "easy" path the judge
  called out, and the target customer is ~Series A and above.
- Repo is otherwise empty — no code, no stack chosen.
